As a highly motivated and detail-oriented individual with a passion for developing and designing websites, I am confident that my skills and experience make me a strong candidate for this role. 

I have been learning both front-end and back-end web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and various frameworks such as React. I am an engineering student in the domain of design so I also study UX/UI design and can work along with the designers.
